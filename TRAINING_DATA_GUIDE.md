# AI Training Data Guide

## How the AI System Works

### Understanding AI Context vs Training

**Your RFP Automated app uses a context-based AI approach, not traditional training:**

1. **No Model Training Required**: The app uses Groq's pre-trained LLaMA models - these are already trained on vast amounts of business knowledge
2. **Context-Based Responses**: Instead of training, the AI uses "context" documents to provide specific, relevant answers
3. **Real-Time Processing**: Documents are processed in real-time to provide contextual information

### Two Types of Document Processing

#### 1. **Question Extraction (File Upload)**
- **Purpose**: Extract questions from RFP documents
- **Location**: Main dashboard "Upload Document" section
- **Supported Formats**: Excel (.xlsx), PDF (.pdf)
- **Process**: Upload → Questions extracted → AI generates responses

#### 2. **Training Context (Admin Panel)**
- **Purpose**: Provide background knowledge for better AI responses
- **Location**: Admin Panel → "Document Library" tab
- **Supported Formats**: PDF, DOC, DOCX, TXT
- **Process**: Upload → Content stored → Used as context for AI responses

### How to Provide Training Data

#### For Administrators:
1. **Login with Admin Account**
2. **Navigate to Admin Panel**
3. **Go to "Document Library" Tab**
4. **Upload Training Documents**:
   - Company policies
   - Previous RFP responses
   - Technical specifications
   - Compliance documents
   - Company overview materials

#### Training Document Types:
- **Company Information**: About your business, services, team size
- **Technical Capabilities**: Technologies, certifications, methodologies
- **Security & Compliance**: Certifications, policies, procedures
- **Case Studies**: Previous successful projects
- **Pricing Guidelines**: Standard rates, pricing models

### Current System Behavior

#### Without Training Documents:
- AI uses general business knowledge
- Provides professional, but generic responses
- Still functional and helpful for RFP responses

#### With Training Documents:
- AI uses your specific company information
- Responses are tailored to your business
- More accurate and personalized answers
- Better source citations

### Example Training Documents

#### 1. Company Profile Document
```
Company Name: TechCorp Solutions
Founded: 2015
Employees: 50+ certified professionals
Revenue: $5M+ annually
Specialties: Digital transformation, cloud migration
Certifications: ISO 27001, SOC 2 Type II
```

#### 2. Technical Capabilities Document
```
Technologies:
- Cloud Platforms: AWS, Azure, GCP
- Languages: Python, JavaScript, Java
- Frameworks: React, Node.js, Django
- DevOps: Docker, Kubernetes, Jenkins
```

#### 3. Security Compliance Document
```
Security Measures:
- 24/7 SOC monitoring
- End-to-end encryption
- Regular penetration testing
- GDPR compliance
- Zero-trust architecture
```

### Best Practices

#### Document Quality:
- **Clear Structure**: Use headings and bullet points
- **Factual Content**: Include specific numbers, dates, certifications
- **Updated Information**: Keep documents current
- **Comprehensive Coverage**: Include all business aspects

#### Document Organization:
- **Company Overview**: Mission, values, history
- **Services & Capabilities**: What you offer
- **Technical Specifications**: How you deliver
- **Compliance & Security**: Certifications and policies
- **Case Studies**: Proven success stories

### Implementation Workflow

1. **Setup Phase**:
   - Create admin account
   - Upload company documents to Admin Panel
   - Test with sample RFP questions

2. **Operation Phase**:
   - Upload RFP documents for question extraction
   - Generate AI responses (now uses your training data)
   - Review and approve responses
   - Export final RFP response

3. **Maintenance Phase**:
   - Update training documents as company evolves
   - Add new case studies and capabilities
   - Monitor response quality and accuracy

### Technical Implementation

The system automatically:
- Indexes uploaded training documents
- Creates searchable context for AI queries
- Provides source citations in responses
- Updates context when new documents are added

This approach provides the benefits of custom training without the complexity of model retraining.
